			<p>
				I'm Benjamin Tiong, a programming professional with a passion for coding.<br>
				Being a 3rd year student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science has enabled me to
				gain an in-depth understanding of the field, and I am excited to put my knowledge into practice.<br>
				I have honed my skills by working on various projects, ranging from professional websites to user-targeted
				applications, all while maintaining a decent GPA considered by current standards.<br>
				I am always looking for opportunities to professionally develop my skills further and help others achieve their goals in the process.
				I believe that sharing knowledge and skills is crucial in achieving success in any field.<br>
				In my spare time, I have developed a keen interest in fitness and nutrition. I hit the gym on a regular basis
				and maintain a well-balanced diet consisting of protein and vegetables. This has helped me stay healthy and energized,
				which is essential for performing well in my academic and professional endeavors.<br>
				Besides fitness and nutrition, I also enjoy watching mainstream TV shows, as they offer a great way to
				stay up-to-date with current trends and popular culture.
